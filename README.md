# Python Debug Test

A Visual Studio Code extension that simplifies debugging Python tests by adding convenient debug buttons directly in your code.

## Features

üîç **One-Click Debugging**
- Debug pytest tests instantly
- Debug unittest tests with a single click
- Full debugging capabilities (breakpoints, variable inspection, step-by-step execution)
- No configuration needed - works out of the box!

‚öôÔ∏è **Smart Configuration**
- Automatic launch.json setup
- Django projects support
- Intelligent test path handling for both pytest and unittest
- Seamless integration with VS Code's debugging features

üéØ **Framework Support**
- pytest: Supports modern pytest features
- unittest: Full unittest framework support
- Django test support included

## Getting Started

1. Install the extension from VS Code Marketplace
2. Open a Python test file
3. Look for the debug buttons above your test methods:
   - "‚ñ∂ Run with pytest"
   - "‚ñ∂ Run with unittest"
4. Click and start debugging!

## Examples

### Pytest Test File
```python
# test_example.py
class TestCalculator:
    def test_addition(self):
        result = 2 + 2
        assert result == 4
```
Debug button will use: `test_example.py::TestCalculator::test_addition`

### Unittest Test File
```python
# test_feature.py
from unittest import TestCase

class TestFeature(TestCase):
    def test_something(self):
        self.assertTrue(True)
```
Debug button will use: `test_feature.TestFeature.test_something`

### Django Test File
```python
# tests/test_views.py
from django.test import TestCase

class TestViews(TestCase):
    def test_home_page(self):
        response = self.client.get('/')
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Debug buttons not showing**
   - Make sure you're in a Python test file
   - Check that the file name starts or ends with "test"
   - Verify that your test functions/methods start with "test"
